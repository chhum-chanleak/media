      'A gigantic, "potentially hazardous" space rock bigger than the Eiffel Tower will enter Earth’s orbit next week, according to NASA. The egg-shaped asteroid, named 4660 Nereus, is 1,082 feet (330 meters) long and will break into Earth’s orbit traveling at 14,700 mph (23,700 km/h) on Saturday, Dec. 11. Thankfully for all of our weekend plans, the asteroid is expected to skim past Earth at some distance without making impact, but it will still be closer to us than it has been in 20 years. Nereus — named after the Greek sea god who was the son of Gaia, the personification of the Earth — will be roughly 2.4 million miles away (3.86 million km), around 10 times the distance between Earth and the moon. This may sound like an enormous gap, but by cosmic standards, it’s actually a stone’s throw away.',

      "In 2067, crop blights and dust storms threaten humanity's survival. Cooper, a widowed engineer and former NASA pilot turned farmer, lives with his father-in-law, Donald, his 15-year-old son, Tom, and 10-year-old daughter, Murphy 'Murph'. After a dust storm, strange dust patterns inexplicably appear in Murphy's bedroom; she attributes the anomaly to a ghost. Cooper eventually deduces the patterns were caused by gravity variations and they represent geographic coordinates in binary code. Cooper follows the coordinates to a secret NASA facility headed by Professor John Brand.",

      "Barcelona boss Xavi Hernandez has described Lionel Messi’s seventh Ballon d’Or win as 'total justice'. Xavi was Messi’s team-mate at the Nou Camp until the Catalan departed for Al Sadd in 2015. In their time together, particularly under Pep Guardiola, they amassed a remarkable transfer haul and can claim to have been part of the best club football side ever. Messi won four of his seven awards as Xavi’s team-mate, and earlier this week secured his most recent trophy. He was one of the frontrunners for the award alongside Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema and Bayern Munich forward Robert Lewandowski.",
